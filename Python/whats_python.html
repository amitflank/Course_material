        <h4>What is Python?</h4>

        <p>
            Python is a <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="High-level Language"> high-level</span>, 
            interpreted, general-purpose programming language as opposed to <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Low Level Language">low level languages</span> 
            such as C, C++ and Rust. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, 
            which makes it a great language for beginners. It is also a versatile language, used for web development, 
            data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Python is a great language to learn if you are interested in programming, 
            as it is widely used and has a large community of developers.
        </p>

        <p>Like many popular languages, Python supports <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="OOP"> object-oriented programming (OOP) </span>. 
           though it as often thought of as multi-paradigm language since code is not restricted to objects. 
            An <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Object">object</span> is an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects. 
            For example, you can define a <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Class">class</span> called "Car" with the attributes "color" and "speed", 
            and <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Function">functions</span> such as "accelerate()" and "decelerate()". 
        </p>

        <p>It's a dynamically-typed language, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable before using it. 
            It's also an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed line-by-line at runtime rather than being compiled beforehand. 
            If these terms don't mean anything to you yet, don't panic! They will soon.
        </p>

        <p>Python is an excellent first programming language choice. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, 
            making it easier for programmers to write clear and intuitive code for both small and large projects.
             It includes a robust standard library that allows programmers to quickly jump in and get started; 
             sometimes it's referred to as the "Lego" of programming languages. Major companies like Google, Instagram, Netflix, and Spotify use Python in their apps.
        </p>

        <p>
            That said, Python may not be the first choice for everyone. Some beginners might prefer something like Java, 
            which enforces static typing and might illustrate some fundamental programming concepts more clearly. 
            Ultimately, the choice of a first programming language depends on an individual's learning style, goals, and preferences.
