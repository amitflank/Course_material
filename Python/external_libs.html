    <h4>Third-Party Libraries</h4>

    <p id="medium-text">Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks that extend the functionality of the language and provide additional tools and resources for developers. 
        These libraries cover a wide range of domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. 
        In this section, we'll explore some of the most popular and widely used third-party libraries in Python and discuss their applications and use cases.</p>

    <p id="medium-text">One of the most commons ways to install and third party library is with a package manager which make the process easy and painless.
        Heres how we can do it with pip one of the most popular package managers. In your terminal or command prompt, type the following command:
        <pre><code> pip install &lt;library name&gt;</code></pre></p>

    <h5>Pytest</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">Pytest is a flexible testing framework that is suitable for both simple and complex tests.
        It provides features like the pytest.mark.parametrize function, which allows testing a function 
        with multiple input values, eliminating the need for writing repetitive test cases.</p>

    <h5>Pygame</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">A collection of Python modules designed for creating and displaying simple video games. 
    It is built on top of the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, which provides low-level multimedia functionality.</p>

    <h5>NumPy</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">The fundamental package for numerical computation in Python, offering features for handling arrays, matrices, 
        and advanced math functions. Its <code>numpy.array()</code> function is used for creating arrays, while 
        <code>numpy.dot()</code> can be used for matrix multiplication.</p>

    <h5>SciPy</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">Focuses on scientific and technical computing and serves as a complement to NumPy. 
        It offers additional modules for various scientific computations. For example, the <code>scipy.integrate.quad()</code> 
        function can be used to compute definite integrals.</p>

    <h5>Matplotlib</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">A versatile library for creating a wide range of visualizations in Python, 
        spanning from basic line plots to interactive charts. The <code>matplotlib.pyplot.plot()</code> 
        function is used for line plots, while <code>matplotlib.pyplot.bar()</code> is employed for bar charts.</p>

    <h5>Pandas</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">A popular library for data manipulation and analysis. It excels at working with numerical tables and time-series data. 
        Functions like <code>pandas.DataFrame()</code> allow for the creation of data frames, while <code>pandas.read_csv()</code> 
        is used to read data from CSV files.</p>

    <h5>Requests</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">Simplifies HTTP requests by hiding complexities behind a clean API. Functions like <code>requests.get()</code> and <code>
        requests.post()</code> allow you to send HTTP GET and POST requests respectively.</p>

    <h5>Flask</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">A simple, lightweight framework that simplifies the development of web applications. 
        It provides a straightforward and minimalist approach for creating server-side applications.</p>

    <h5>Django</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">A high-level web framework that enables rapid and secure website development. 
        It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing a comprehensive set of tools and 
        libraries for building robust web applications.</p>

    <h5>TensorFlow</h5>
    <p id="medium-text">Popular for machine learning tasks, particularly for constructing and training deep learning models. 
        It offers a rich set of tools and resources to facilitate machine learning experimentation and deployment.</p>
