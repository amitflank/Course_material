        <h4>Best Practices for Python</h4>
        
        <p>Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is used in a wide variety of applications. Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing Python code:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Use descriptive variable names</b></li>
            <p>Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful. This makes the code easier to read and understand. For example, instead of using a variable name like "x", use a name like "user_input" to indicate what the variable represents.</p>
            <li><b>Follow PEP 8 guidelines</b></li>
            <p>PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. It provides guidelines for writing clean, readable code. Following these guidelines makes your code more consistent and easier to maintain.</p>
            <li><b>Use comments to explain your code</b></li>
            <p>Comments are used to explain the purpose of the code and how it works. They are essential for making your code understandable to others and to your future self.</p>
            <li><b>Write modular code</b></li>
            <p>Modular code is code that is broken down into smaller, reusable components. This makes the code easier to maintain and test, and reduces the likelihood of errors.</p>
            <li><b>Use meaningful function and class names</b></li>
