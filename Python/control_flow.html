        <h4>What is control flow?</h4>

        <p id="medium-text">Control flow refers to methods of executing code blocks in a certain order based on specific conditions or criteria. 
            These methods include branching and looping. Control flow is important in programming because it allows developers to 
            control the behavior of their programs and make them more efficient and flexible.</p>

        <h5>Conditional statements (branching)</h5>

        <div class="home_container">

			<div class="text-container">
                <p><b>Conditional statements</b> allow the execution of different code paths based on certain 
                    conditions. The most common type of conditional statement is the <b>if statement</b>, 
                    which executes a block of code if a given condition is true, and otherwise executes another 
                    block of code within an <b>else statement</b>, or does nothing. This enables programmers to make their 
                    programs more responsive to different scenarios. “If” statements can be <b>nested</b>
                    (an “if” statement within another “if” statement.)</p>

        <h5>Looping</h5>

        <div class="home_container">

			<div class="text-container">
                <p><span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Looping"> Loops</span>, are used in programming to repeatedly execute a set of instructions. 
                They let the programmer automate repetitive tasks and iterate over collections of 
                data. There are two commonly used types of loops: <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="For Loop"> for loops</span>, which are used to 
                iterate once per every item in a sequence of values, and <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="While Loop"> while loops</span>, 
                which are used to repeatedly execute code until a certain condition is met.</p>

            <div class="image-container">

        <h5>Exception Handling</h5>

        <p id="medium-text"><b>Exception handling</b> allows programmers to handle errors that would otherwise crash the program.
             When an <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Exception"> exception</span> occurs, the program can <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Catch"> "catch"</span> 
             it and take appropriate actions, such as displaying an error message or executing alternate code to handle the situation. 
             In Python this is done with try and except statements. If a block of code within a <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Try"> "try"</span> 
             statement would normally crash, the code execution is redirected to the corresponding “except” statement, 
             which can handle the exception and take appropriate actions. For example, if a program attempts to divide by zero inside of a “try” block, 
             the "except" block could display an error message instead of crashing.</p>

        <h5>Functions</h5>

        <p id="medium-text"><span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Function">Functions</span> are blocks of code that perform a specific task, 
            and can be <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Called">called</span> multiple times throughout a program. 
            They help to break down large programs into smaller, more manageable parts. Functions easily allow for code reuse, 
            since the same function can be called from different parts of a program with different inputs resulting in different outputs. 
            Functions may or may not take one or more inputs (called <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Argument">arguments</span>) 
            and may or may not <span class="vocab-term" data-term-id="Return Value">return</span> an output value.
        Lets look at an example:
        <pre><code>#defining a function&#10;def add_numbers(x, y):&#10;&emsp;sum = x + y:&#10;&emsp;return sum&#10;&#10;#Calling a function&#10;result = add_numbers(5, 7)&#10;print(result)</code></pre></p>
    
        <p id="medium-text">In Python, functions are <b>defined</b> using the "def" keyword, followed by the function name and any necessary <b>parameters</b> 
        (a placeholder for arguments). This is followed by the <b>body</b> code, which is indented. 
        Everything inside the body will execute every time the function is called, substituting any 
        parameter placeholders with whatever arguments were passed into the function call.</p>
