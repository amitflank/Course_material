        <p>Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer; things that can be actually seen and held. 
            Software, on the other hand, refers to the intangible parts. Software programs tell the hardware what to do.</p>

        <p>When buying, building, or upgrading a computer, there are a few key factors to keep in mind:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> ensure that the components you choose are compatible with each other and with the operating system you want to install.</li>
            <li><strong>Power supply</strong>: choose a power supply that can provide enough power for all the components you plan to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> make sure the components are adequately cooled to avoid overheating and reduce the risk of damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> follow the instructions carefully and take precautions to avoid static electricity and physical damage to the components.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" class="pretty_link">PCPartPicker</a> is a great resource for researching and comparing parts. If you choose not to build your own computer, 
            there are still some hardware and software tips that can help keep your system running smoothly:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your software up to date this includes your operating system, drivers, and any other software you use.</li>
            <li>Install and regularly update anti-virus and anti-malware software to protect against threats.</li>
            <li>Keep your system clean and dust-free to avoid overheating and reduce the risk of damage.</li>
            <li>Regularly backup important data to prevent loss in case of hardware failure or other issues.</li>
            <li>Use surge protectors or an <strong>uninterruptible power supply</strong> (pictured below) to protect your system from power fluctuations and outages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="red">Hardware</h2>

        <h5 id="Base">Base Unit</h5>
        <p>The main part of a computer, also called the <b>system</b> <b>unit</b> or the <b>tower</b>. Made up of many different components housed inside of a case.
             Does not include peripheral devices such as the monitor, keyboard, or mouse, which are connected to it.</p>

        <h5>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>CPU</strong> (central processing unit) is the brain of the computer. It manages all of the other hardware and processes by performing calculations and sending/receiving electrical signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Clock Speed: </strong> The speed of a CPU is measured in GHz (gigahertz) and determines how fast it can perform instructions. Higher GHz means faster processing speeds, though it also requires more power and more cooling.</li>
            <li><strong>Core count:</strong> The CPU can have one or more processing units, known as cores. More cores mean the CPU can perform more tasks simultaneously, which can improve overall system performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> The CPU generates a lot of heat as it operates, so it needs to be properly cooled to prevent overheating. This is typically done using a heatsink and a fan, which are attached to the CPU with thermal paste.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Motherboard</h5>
        <p>If the CPU is the brain of a computer, then the motherboard is the central nervous system. 
            It's the main circuit board that allows for the other components to connect and communicate with each other.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form Factor</strong>: Motherboards come in different sizes, known as form factors. The most common form factor for desktop computers is ATX, while smaller form factors like Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX are used for more compact builds.</li>
            <li><strong>Expansion Slots</strong>: The motherboard has slots for expansion cards, such as graphics cards, sound cards, or Wi-Fi cards, which allow for extra functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>BIOS:</strong> The Basic Input/Output System is a chip on the motherboard that initializes the hardware components and allows you to configure basic settings.</li>
            
        </ul>
