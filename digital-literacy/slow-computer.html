        <h1 class="large-header">Why is my computer so slow?</h1>

        <p id="medium-scale">Many things can cause your computer to chug. Here are some tips to find and resolve these issues 
            to improve your computer's performance.</p>

        <h4 class="medium-header">Too many programs running</h4>
        <p id="medium-scale">When you open a program, it loads data into your computer's RAM and uses processing power to perform tasks. 
            If you have too many programs running simultaneously, they will compete for system resources, which can slow down your 
            computer's overall performance. To identify which programs are using the most resources, open Task Manager using Ctrl+Shift+Esc, 
            sort the processes by CPU or memory usage, and end those processes that are not critical.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">Some programs (like Steam and Discord) start up automatically by default when you turn on your computer. 
            This can slow down your system's boot time and performance, so be sure to disable unnecessary startup programs in your settings. 
            To disable startup apps on Windows, go to the Task Manager, click on the "Startup" tab, and disable any programs you don't need. 
            On macOS, go to "System Preferences" and click on "Users & Groups," then select your user account and click on the "Login Items" tab. 
            From there, you can uncheck any programs you don't need to start automatically</p>

        <h4 class="medium-header">Malware</h4>
        <p id="medium-scale"><strong>Malware</strong> is malicious software designed to harm or disrupt computers, often spread through emails, downloads, 
            or infected websites. Viruses and other malware can infect your computer and cause a wide range of issues 
            by consuming system resources without your knowledge. Some malware, such as cryptocurrency miners, are 
            specifically designed to use your computer's resources to generate digital currency, which can significantly slow down your computer.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale"><strong>Antivirus software</strong> can scan your system for viruses, malware, and other malicious programs, and quarantine or remove them if found. 
            It's essential to keep your antivirus software up to date, as new threats are constantly emerging.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">Additionally, it's essential to be cautious when downloading files or clicking on links from untrusted sources, 
            as these are common ways that malware can infect your computer. Always make sure to download software and files 
            from reputable sources, and avoid clicking on suspicious links or email attachments.</p>

        </div>
    
        <h4 class="medium-header">Disk Fragmentation</h4>
        <p id="medium-scale">Disk fragmentation is a common occurrence on a computer's hard drive as files are added, deleted, and moved over time. 
            This scattered distribution of file pieces slows down overall performance as the computer has to search for all the scattered data.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale"><strong>Defragmentation</strong> is the process of consolidating all the scattered pieces of files on the hard drive, 
            making it easier for the computer to access the file quickly. On Windows, the "Defragment and Optimize Drives" 
            tool can be used to analyze and optimize the selected drive. Newer versions of Windows automatically defragment 
            the hard drive, but manual defragmentation may still be necessary in some cases. On macOS, the built-in Disk Utility 
            tool can be used to check for fragmentation and perform a verification process</p>
            
        <h4 class="medium-header">Insufficient RAM</h4>
        <p id="medium-scale">To determine the right amount of RAM for your computer, consider your intended use. For general tasks, 4GB to 8GB of RAM is usually enough, 
            while more demanding activities like gaming may require 16GB or more. Check the software's system requirements for recommended RAM amounts. 
            It's important to find a balance between your needs and your budget; having more RAM than you need won't improve your performance</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">Insufficient RAM can cause your computer to slow down, particularly when running multiple programs at the same time. 
            To check your memory usage, you can use Task Manager on Windows or the Activity Monitor on Mac. If your memory usage is 
            consistently high or close to 100% while running your programs, you may require more RAM. 
            Check if your motherboard has available RAM slots and buy compatible RAM sticks if it does</p>

        <h4 class="medium-header">Operating System Issues</h4>

        <p id="medium-scale">Over time, your computer's OS may become corrupted due to malware infections, hardware failures, or other factors, 
            resulting in slower performance or other issues. If you suspect that your computer's operating system is causing 
            performance issues, there are several diagnostic steps you can take. One of the first things to do is to run a virus 
            scan and malware removal tool to ensure that your system is not infected. If you have already done this, you can try 
            checking your system's event logs for error messages or running a system file checker to check for corrupted system files.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">If none of these steps work, you may need to consider reinstalling the operating system. 
            Before you do this, be sure to back up all of your important files and data to an external 
            drive or cloud storage, since the reinstallation process will erase all of the files on your computer. 
            Reinstalling the operating system can be a complex process, but it can help to restore your computer's 
            performance and resolve any lingering issues.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">Reinstalling the operating system should be your last resort and should only be done if all other 
            diagnostic steps have failed to fix the issue.</p>
        
        <h4 class="medium-header">Outdated Hardware</h4>

        <p id="medium-scale">Over time, aging computer hardware can wear down or become outdated, eventually leading to poor performance. 
            If you notice that your computer is slowing down, frequently crashing, or unable to run the latest software or 
            operating system updates, it may be a sign that your hardware is getting old. Upgrading hardware components like 
            the processor, hard drive, or graphics card can help extend the life of your computer and make it more efficient.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">However, not all hardware upgrades are worth the cost. Before you invest in upgrading your hardware, 
            you should consider the age of your computer, your budget, and your specific needs. In some cases, 
            it may be more cost-effective to replace your computer with a new one, especially if your current computer is more than 5 years old.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">It's also worth mentioning that if your computer is slowing down, it may not necessarily be due to aging hardware. 
            There could be other reasons such as software issues, malware, or insufficient storage space, so it's important 
            to diagnose the root cause of the problem before investing in any hardware upgrades.</p>
