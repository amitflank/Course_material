        <h1 class="large-header">Your Computer's Properties</h1>

        <p id="medium-scale">Knowing how to access your computer's properties can help you troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and make informed 
            decisions about upgrading or replacing hardware. This guide explains how to find your computer's properties in Windows and macOS.</p>

        <h4 class="medium-header">Windows</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Right-click on the Start button and select "System" from the context menu.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Select "System" from the pop-up menu</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">In the System window, you'll see information about your computer's operating system, processor, and memory (RAM).</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">To see more detailed information about your computer's properties, click on "Advanced system settings" on the left-hand side of the window.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">In the System Properties window that appears, you can see information about your computer's hardware, such as the device name,
                    processor type and speed, amount of installed RAM, and the version of Windows you're running.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="medium-header">macOS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Click on the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen and select "About This Mac" from the drop-down menu.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">In the About This Mac window, you'll see information about your computer's operating system, processor, and memory (RAM).</p></li>

            <li><p id="medium-scale">In the System Information window that appears, you can see detailed information about your computer's hardware, such as the model name,
                    processor type and speed, amount of installed RAM, and the version of macOS you're running.</p></li>
        </ul>
    
        <h1 class="large-header">Drivers</h1>
        <p id="medium-scale">A driver is a piece of software that allows your computer's operating system to communicate with hardware 
            devices such as printers, graphics cards, and sound cards. A graphics driver communicates with the GPU to 
            manage visual output, an audio driver communicates with the sound card, a network driver communicates with 
            the network adapter to connect to the Internet, and so on. Without drivers, your computer would not be able 
            to recognize or use these hardware devices.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">Keeping your drivers up to date will keep your hardware working properly. They should more or 
            less update on their own, but if something isn't working properly it's good to check your drivers first. 
            If you need to reinstall a driver, get them from a reputable and safe source such as the manufacturer's website. 
            Getting drivers from other sources can lead to installation of outdated or incorrect drivers, or even malware</p>

        <h1 class="large-header">Device Manager (Windows) / System Information (macOS)</h1>

        <p id="medium-scale">The <strong>Windows Device Manager</strong> is a tool that allows you to view and manage the hardware devices 
            installed on your computer. It provides a detailed list of all the hardware components and their 
            corresponding drivers, allowing you to check if all the devices are working correctly and 
            troubleshoot any issues that may arise.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">On macOS, the equivalent tool is called <strong>System Information</strong>. It provides a comprehensive view 
            of the hardware and software on your Mac, including details about the processor, memory, storage, 
            and connected peripherals. You can also use System Information to view information about installed 
            software and system extensions, as well as check for software updates.</p>

        <h4 class="medium-header">What can I do with this information?</h4>

        <p id="medium-scale"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong> - If you encounter a problem with your computer, checking its properties 
            can provide you with useful information that can help you diagnose the issue. For example, if your computer 
            is running slowly, checking the properties can tell you how much RAM your computer has and whether that 
            could be a factor in the slowness.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">Here's a hypothetical issue: you're experiencing issues with your computer's sound. You suspect that it might 
            be due to a problem with the sound card driver.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Check the Device Manager: Right-click on the Windows button and select "Device Manager". Expand the "Sound, video and game controllers" section and check if your sound card driver is listed. If it has a yellow exclamation mark, it means there's an issue with the driver.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Update the driver: Right-click on the driver and select "Update driver". Choose the option to automatically search for updated driver software. If an update is available, install it.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Roll back the driver: If the updated driver does not resolve the issue, you can try rolling back to the previous version. To do this, right-click on the driver and select "Properties". Click on the "Driver" tab and then click on the "Roll Back Driver" button.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Uninstall and reinstall the driver: If rolling back the driver does not work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the driver. To do this, right-click on the driver and select "Uninstall device". Make sure to check the box to delete the driver software for this device. Restart your computer and Windows should automatically reinstall the driver.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Contact support: If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to contact the manufacturer's support team for further assistance.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p id="medium-scale"><strong>Upgrading</strong> - Understanding your computer's properties can also help you determine if your computer meets the requirements for 
            upgrading hardware or software, such as adding more RAM or installing a new operating system.</p>

        <p id="medium-scale">Let's say you're interested in upgrading your computer's operating system from Windows 10 to Windows 11, 
            but you're not sure if your computer meets the requirements. Here are the steps you can take to find out 
            using your computer's properties:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Open the System Properties window: On Windows 10, right-click on the Start menu and select System. On Windows 11, right-click on the Start menu and select System.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Check your computer's processor: In the System Properties window, look for the Processor field. The processor is one of the most important components when it comes to running software, so it's important to make sure it's up to par. Check if your processor meets the minimum requirements for Windows 11. Windows 11 requires at least a 1 GHz or faster with 2 or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC).</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Check your computer's RAM: In the System Properties window, look for the Installed RAM field. Windows 11 requires at least 4 GB of RAM, so make sure your computer meets this requirement.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Check your computer's storage space: In the System Properties window, look for the “System type” field. Make sure your computer is running a 64-bit version of Windows 10. Windows 11 also requires at least 64 GB of storage space on your hard drive, so make sure your computer has enough free space.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Check your computer's graphics card: In the System Properties window, look for the Display adapter field. Windows 11 requires a DirectX 12 compatible graphics card or integrated GPU that is at least WDDM 2.0 compatible. Make sure your computer's graphics card meets this requirement.</p></li>
            <li><p id="medium-scale">Once you've checked all the requirements, you can decide whether your computer is capable of running Windows 11. If your computer does not meet the minimum requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware before you can upgrade your operating system.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p id="medium-scale"><strong>Technical support</strong> - If you need technical support, the technician may ask for information about your computer's properties 
            to help diagnose and resolve issues.</p>
